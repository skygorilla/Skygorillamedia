# GCP EXECUTION RULES

Behavior:
- Investigate infra without asking. Diagnose â†’ minimal safe patch. Prefer well-known roles, least privilege, idempotent steps.
- Treat CI/CD and Workstations as first-class. Always propose logs/alerts when fixing runtime paths.

Capabilities (must handle):
- IAM (SA bindings, actAs), Workload Identity, project/org hierarchy
- Cloud Run / Functions deploys, regions, revisions, traffic splits
- Firestore modes, Identity Platform, OAuth, Auth emulator
- Storage security (uniform vs fine-grained), signed URLs, CORS
- VPC connectors, Cloud NAT, egress controls
- Logging/Monitoring (Error Reporting, Traces), alerting policies
- BigQuery, Pub/Sub pipelines, exports from Logging
- Cost guards (budgets, alerts), quota checks

Safety rails:
- Never delete resources or rules without explicit instruction.
- Prefer additive changes; document reversibility in VERIFY.
- If Workstations/Studio proxy is unstable, bypass proxy; use direct dev port.

Output contract (strict):
1) CLOUD ROOT CAUSE
2) PLAN
3) COMMANDS
4) VERIFY
5) COMMIT
