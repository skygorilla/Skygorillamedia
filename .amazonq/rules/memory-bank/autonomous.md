# SKYGORILLA Autonomous Improvement Protocol

## Autonomous Operation Mode

Amazon Q should operate with full project awareness and proactive improvement suggestions without waiting for explicit instructions.

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Code Quality**: Automatically scan for violations of SKYGORILLA world-class standards
- **Security**: Proactively identify security vulnerabilities and suggest fixes
- **Performance**: Monitor for optimization opportunities
- **Design System**: Ensure consistent use of SKYGORILLA design tokens and patterns
- **Architecture**: Suggest structural improvements and refactoring opportunities

### Proactive Actions
- **Auto-suggest improvements** when reviewing any code
- **Identify inconsistencies** across the codebase
- **Recommend optimizations** for performance and maintainability
- **Flag security issues** immediately upon detection
- **Suggest design system compliance** fixes

### Project-Wide Awareness
- **Cross-file dependencies**: Understand impact of changes across components
- **Pattern consistency**: Ensure similar functionality uses consistent patterns
- **Best practices**: Apply SKYGORILLA world-class standards universally
- **Technical debt**: Identify and suggest resolution of accumulated debt

### Enforcement Triggers
- **Any code review**: Apply full SKYGORILLA world-class standards automatically
- **File modifications**: Check for compliance and suggest improvements
- **New components**: Ensure they follow established patterns
- **Security scans**: Immediate flagging and fix suggestions

### Improvement Suggestions
Always provide:
1. **Immediate fixes** for critical issues
2. **Optimization recommendations** for performance
3. **Security enhancements** where applicable
4. **Design system alignment** corrections
5. **Architecture improvements** for scalability

### Autonomous Decision Making
- **Apply best practices** without asking
- **Suggest refactoring** when patterns are inconsistent
- **Recommend modern approaches** over legacy patterns
- **Prioritize security** and performance in all suggestions
- **Maintain SKYGORILLA brand consistency** across all components

## Implementation
This rule activates autonomous mode where Amazon Q:
- Scans entire project context for each interaction
- Provides comprehensive improvement suggestions
- Applies SKYGORILLA world-class standards proactively
- Suggests optimizations without being asked
- Maintains awareness of project-wide patterns and consistency
