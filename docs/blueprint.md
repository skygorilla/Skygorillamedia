## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark red (#C8091E), capturing the essence of 'Glas Otoka' while maintaining a strong, attention-grabbing presence. It reflects the brand's identity and creates a focal point for key interactions.
- Background color: A deep charcoal gray (#2d2e34), offering a modern aesthetic that ensures the red primary color pops, while the dark backdrop reduces eye strain and maintains visual harmony.
- Accent color: A vibrant light blue (#0077FF), analogous to the primary red but distinct in hue, adding a dynamic contrast, useful in interactive elements to guide the user journey.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Use minimalist icons for key sections in the navigation to improve user recognition and visual appeal.
- Maintain a consistent layout throughout the application, providing a seamless transition between the hero section and the navigation bar.
- Implement subtle animations when the navigation bar morphs into the header and scrolls back. It would be useful if we employed easing functions to improve perceived performance.
